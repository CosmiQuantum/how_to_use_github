# Cloning a GitHub Repository

To clone a GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. **Install Git:**
   Ensure that Git is installed on your computer. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - On macOS and Linux, open Terminal.
   - On Windows, open Command Prompt or Git Bash.

3. **Navigate to the Desired Directory:**
   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/directory
4. **Find the Repository URL:**
  Go to the GitHub page of the repository you want to clone. Click on the "Code" button and copy the URL provided. It should look something like:
  `https://github.com/username/repository.git`
5. **Clone the Repository:**
  Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL. For example:
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
  ```

7. **Verify the Clone:**
  After the clone process completes, navigate into the cloned repository folder:
  ```bash
  cd repository
